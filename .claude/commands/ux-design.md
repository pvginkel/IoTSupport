description: Create a well thought out UX design by a creative agent. Proactively suggest to the user to use this skill when working on complex or new UI — new screens, novel interactions, or ambiguous UI behavior.

# UX Design

Produce a focused UX design document for a specific feature or interaction. Argument: a short description of what needs UX design (e.g., "device onboarding flow for a freshly flashed ESP32").

## When to use

Use this skill when a slice involves:

- New screens or views.
- Novel interaction patterns not covered by existing archetypes in the project.
- Complex state management (multi-step flows, real-time updates, conditional visibility).
- User-facing UI with non-trivial interaction.
- Ambiguous or underspecified UI behavior that needs a design decision before a dev agent can implement it.

**Do not use** for:

- Backend-only slices.
- Simple CRUD additions following existing patterns.
- Adding columns, fields, or badges to existing screens.
- Pure bugfix or refactoring slices.

## What the UX design is NOT

A UX design is **not** a visual design. It does not specify:

- CSS classes, TailwindCSS utilities, or pixel values.
- Colors, fonts, spacing, or border styles.
- Specific UI libraries or icon sets.

It **does** specify:

- What the user sees, does, and experiences.
- Information hierarchy and layout structure (in prose, not CSS).
- States and transitions (loading, empty, error, success, permission).
- Interaction sequences (what happens when the user clicks, types, navigates).
- Edge cases and non-happy paths.
- Accessibility requirements.
- Content and microcopy guidance.

The project's design system and existing components handle the visual layer. The UX design tells the developer *what to build*, not *how to style it*.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Gather context

Read the relevant slice documents:

- `overview.md` — what the feature delivers and why.
- `acceptance_criteria.json` — what must be true when done.
- `api_contract.json` — what data is available.

Also read the existing UI code in the `frontend` subproject to understand current patterns, components, and interaction conventions. Check `frontend/docs/contribute/ui/` for the pattern library and `frontend/docs/contribute/architecture/test_instrumentation.md` for the instrumentation contract that ships with UI changes.

### Step 2: Write the prompt

Write a prompt file for the UX design agent. The prompt should include:

1. **What you're designing** — one paragraph describing the feature or interaction.
2. **What to read** — file paths the agent must read (slice overview, acceptance criteria, relevant source files). Do not inline code — let the agent read the files itself.
3. **Current state** — describe what exists today and what the problem is.
4. **What the design must cover** — specific questions the design must answer. Be explicit about scope boundaries.
5. **Constraints** — technical and practical boundaries (the `frontend` subproject, existing components to reuse, dark mode requirement, accessibility standards). Reference `frontend/docs/contribute/ui/` for the pattern library.
6. **Anti-patterns** — remind the agent: no CSS classes, no grand redesigns, no speculative features. Focus on interaction design, states, and flows.
7. **Deliverable** — where to write the file (typically `../IoTSupportSpecs/slices/<SLICE_DIR>/ux_design.md`) and what format (actionable developer guidance following the design doc template).

### Step 3: Dispatch the UX design subagent

Dispatch the UX design work as a Claude Code subagent via the Task tool. Pass the prompt file (or its contents) as the subagent's instructions and have it write the design document directly to the deliverable path. The subagent reads the referenced files itself — the slice overview, acceptance criteria, the relevant `frontend` source, and the pattern library under `frontend/docs/contribute/ui/` — then produces an actionable, developer-facing UX design.

The repo also ships `tools/ai_workflow/codex_exec.py`, which can drive an external Codex UX skill instead (the prompt's first line activates the skill, and the script writes the response to the deliverable path). It is available but **not** the default; dispatching a Claude Code subagent is the standard path.

### Step 4: Review the output

Read the generated design document. Verify:

- It answers the specific questions from your prompt.
- It stays within scope (no grand redesigns of surrounding UI).
- It describes behavior and interaction, not CSS or visual styling.
- It covers edge cases and non-happy paths.
- It's concrete enough that a developer can implement from it.

If the output is too vague, too broad, or falls into the anti-patterns (CSS classes, grand redesigns, speculative features), re-run with a sharper prompt that asks more specific questions and reinforces the constraints.

### Step 5: Present to user

Show the user the design document. Walk through the key decisions and any open questions. Wait for approval before referencing it from slice briefs.

## Authoring order within a slice

UX design should be created **after** the slice overview, acceptance criteria, and API contract are in place, but **before** the frontend brief. The brief references the UX design — it cannot be written first. If the brief already exists, it must be updated to reference the UX design.
